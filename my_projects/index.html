			<h2> Flat TODO List </h2>
			<p class="description">This is an offline webapp built with <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>.
			It's a basic TODO List with HTML5 Web Storage as database and nice flat design with some candy animations
         in CSS3. In this project I've used <a href="http://gruntjs.com">GruntJS</a> for automating some tasks like
         compilation and minification. The web app is available <a href="http://rubensdev.com/todo-app">here</a>

			<h2>Pium Pium</h2>
			<p class="description">This is my first game in Android, built with 
			<a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">LibGDX Framework</a>.The idea came up when I was playing with box2d physics, 
			drawing rectangles and make them crash. I was amazed the fun it was and I made one of them fly. Then, I made the flying 
			rectangle could shoot and the rest of rectangles were the enemies moving randomly over a terrain. Just imagination and 
			some textures applied and voil√°. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubensdev.rphysics">Link to Play Store</a>.</p>

			<h2>BatonMan</h2>
			<p class="description">A colleague from university gave me the idea of making an entertainment app which 
			consisted in moving a baton and act like a orchestra director. If you stop, the music stops. That's just it.

			<h2>Simple</h2>
			<p class="description"> Simple was my first Android app. I didn't know what to do and I was eager to develop 
			for Android. So I was researching a bit and finally I made it using canvas in the whole app. That was crazy, but 
			fun and sometimes is interesting get out of the common.
