Today, I feel like a [lemming][lemmings]. Few days ago I started a project and everything was going quite good. Learning by doing like I love it, 
until the time of putting everything learned in practice and making some stuff (this is the part when I explain why I'm feeling like a lemming)

When you tell a lemming to build stairs up, it starts to do it, but in a few seconds, it shrugs its shoulders and falls over. What I mean is sometimes 
one feels excited, acts too quickly and makes things without a previous organization. Sometimes is about trying if a feature can be done and when you 
realize that it's possible, you add another features and so on. You perhaps didn't think about the proper directory structure for your project, the 
proper patterns. You just code, watch it works and being so happy with that. It's your pet project, you can make whatever you want with it!

You start to 'build those stairs up' and when the stairs are growing too high (your project is big), you shrug your shoulders and you fall into the void.

In conclusion (mind note to myself), organization is the most important thing when you start a project, alone or with others. May take long time, but it worth. 
One never knows if your small project could grow so high and so fast.
