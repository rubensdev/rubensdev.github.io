There's nothing more pleasant than try things by oneself and check they are working like a charm. Sometimes is just necessary to code with self-confidence and think in your own judgement, because when we read other people's code or take several advices, we start to make things hesitating constantly and maybe we get stuck in that.

So I don't know if it were possible to make Jekyll and AngularJS work together. But I tried it and I got it. I wanted to filter my post's contents, and I saw how quite good AngularJS made it.
