The last weeks I've been working with AngularJS and I've felt very comfortable with it. It's a framework that gives 
so much possibilities and awesome ways to organize the structure of your web app. One thing I liked it very much was 
custom components with Angular Directives. I found a slider which I used for changing the tasks color and I left with 
the desire to dissect it and learn very much about it, because it's important to master these kind of things for making 
reusable components. But I'm not only interested in frontend, but in backend too. So I wanted to finish the app as soon 
as possible for moving on with NodeJS and Express framework.

Maybe one day I'll write a tutorial about AngularJS Directives by making a custom and reusable component for your apps.
