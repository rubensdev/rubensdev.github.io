This week I started a new project. It's a TODO List based on an offline webapp, so you could use it in your smartphone 
or your computer (when I finish it). In order to make it, I had to dissect the Paul Lewis Weight Tracker webapp. The 
things you learn watching other's code are amazing, I totally recommend it, if you have a moment.

I've always been curious about offline webapps, how they work like a native application. The best thing is they depend on the browser and, 
therefore, you could use it in any device or computer without depending on operative systems. Yeah, I know, maybe some features could not 
be implemented but I think this is about time. 

Anyways, the experience I'm having with this project is awesome and maybe a TODO List app could be the most repetitive app example 
in the history of Software Development, but I'm trying to be a good resource if any enterprise is interested in making a webapp for 
its projects. I think this is something that people is forgetting, with all these entrepreneur stuffs. A business plenty of ideas and
more ideas but no capable people for making them possible.
